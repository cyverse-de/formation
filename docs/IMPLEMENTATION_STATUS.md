# Formation Implementation Status

## Overview

Formation is an MCP-optimized alternative to the Terrain API, designed for efficient and secure interaction with CyVerse Discovery Environment services through AI agents and automated tools.

**Key Design Principles:**
- Minimal, flat JSON responses (no verbose nesting)
- Generic terminology (no "VICE" branding exposed to users)
- Integration with existing services (apps, app-exposer) rather than direct K8s management
- Comprehensive test coverage for development confidence

## Completed Implementation (Phase 1)

### Core Infrastructure ✅
- FastAPI application framework
- Keycloak OIDC authentication
- PostgreSQL database connection
- iRODS datastore integration (read operations)
- HTTP clients for apps and app-exposer services

### Authentication ✅
- `POST /login` - Username/password login via HTTP Basic Auth
- JWT token verification for protected endpoints
- Bearer token support for API requests

### Data Operations (Read-Only) ✅
- `GET /data/browse/{path}` - Browse directories and read file contents
- iRODS permissions checking
- Metadata retrieval as HTTP headers
- Pagination support for large files
- Content-Type detection

### Interactive App Management ✅
- `POST /app/launch` - Submit analysis to apps service
- `GET /app/{id}/status` - Check analysis status and URL readiness
- `POST /app/{id}/control` - Control operations (extend time, save & exit, exit)

### Testing Infrastructure ✅
- pytest configuration with async support
- Test directory structure (unit, integration)
- Mocking framework for unit tests
- 22 passing unit tests with 100% success rate
- Comprehensive manual testing guide (TESTING.md)

## Pending Implementation (Next Phases)

### Phase 2: Data Write Operations
- [ ] Upload files to iRODS
- [ ] Move/rename files and directories
- [ ] Delete files and directories
- [ ] Create directories
- [ ] Set metadata (AVUs)
- [ ] Unit tests for write operations

### Phase 3: Search & Discovery
- [ ] Search for available apps
- [ ] Search analyses by user/status
- [ ] Search data in iRODS
- [ ] List recent analyses

### Phase 4: Integration & Advanced Features
- [ ] Integration test suite for live services
- [ ] QuickLaunches (saved configurations)
- [ ] Sharing workflows
- [ ] Permissions management API
- [ ] Batch operations

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables

**Required for all operations:**
```bash
# Database
DB_HOST=your-db-host
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=de
DB_PASSWORD=secret
DB_NAME=de

# iRODS
IRODS_HOST=data.cyverse.org
IRODS_PORT=1247
IRODS_USER=service-account
IRODS_PASSWORD=secret
IRODS_ZONE=iplant

# Keycloak
KEYCLOAK_SERVER_URL=https://auth.example.com
KEYCLOAK_REALM=CyVerse
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=formation
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET=secret
KEYCLOAK_SSL_VERIFY=true
```

**Required for app operations:**
```bash
# Apps service
APPS_BASE_URL=https://de.cyverse.org/api/apps

# App-exposer service
APP_EXPOSER_BASE_URL=https://de.cyverse.org/api/app-exposer
```

## Running Formation

### Development Mode
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync --group test

# Run server with auto-reload
uv run fastapi dev main.py

# Server will be available at http://localhost:8000
# API docs at http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Production Mode
```bash
uv run fastapi run main.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# All unit tests
uv run pytest tests/unit/ -v

# With coverage
uv run pytest tests/unit/ --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Specific test file
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_clients.py -v
```

## Code Quality

### Linting & Formatting
```bash
# Format code
uv run ruff format

# Check and fix issues
uv run ruff check --fix
```

### Dependencies
- Production deps: 6 packages (FastAPI, httpx, psycopg, python-irodsclient, python-jose, authlib)
- Test deps: 5 packages (pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov, pytest-mock, pytest-httpx)
- Dev deps: 1 package (ruff)

## Architecture Decisions

### Why not direct Kubernetes access?
Formation integrates with the existing DE architecture by calling the apps and app-exposer services rather than managing K8s directly. This approach:
- Leverages existing, battle-tested deployment logic
- Maintains consistency with web UI behavior
- Reduces maintenance burden
- Allows apps service to handle complex job submission logic

### Why minimal JSON responses?
To optimize for MCP tool usage:
- Reduces token consumption in AI agent contexts
- Easier to parse and understand
- Faster serialization/deserialization
- Less bandwidth usage

### Why avoid "VICE" terminology?
"VICE" is CyVerse branding. Formation uses generic terms like "app" and "analysis" to:
- Be more intuitive for new users
- Allow potential reuse in other contexts
- Focus on functionality over branding

## Known Limitations

1. **Log retrieval not implemented** - Additional work needed in backend services
2. **Write operations pending** - iRODS uploads, moves, deletes need implementation
3. **No batch operations yet** - Single operations only (can be added in Phase 4)
4. **Integration tests not written** - Manual testing required for now
5. **No app search/discovery** - Direct app IDs must be provided

## Next Steps

**Immediate priorities:**
1. Implement iRODS write operations (upload, move, delete)
2. Add unit tests for data write operations
3. Create integration test suite
4. Test against live DE services

**Future enhancements:**
1. App search and discovery endpoints
2. Analysis search and filtering
3. QuickLaunch support
4. Sharing and permissions APIs
5. WebSocket support for real-time updates

## Success Metrics

**Current Status:**
- ✅ 3 major endpoints implemented
- ✅ 22 unit tests passing
- ✅ 0 test failures
- ✅ Clean code (ruff compliant)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

**Target for Production:**
- Integration tests covering critical paths
- Manual testing completed and documented
- Load testing for concurrent requests
- Security audit of authentication flow
- Deployment automation (Docker, K8s)

## Contributing
